# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The webpage created during the module is working as intended, but we would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape to enhance the website. 
## Results
The website built during the Module had functionality to filter by the date of the UFO sighting. Currently it includes additional filter capabilities to further narrow down a specific subset of UFO sightings. In the follwing we will provide brief instructions on how a user can filter through the list of sightings to create a subset of the data based on the shape of the unidentified flying object they might be interested in studying more. 

For example if someone wanted to narrow down the sightings to focus on a specific shape, circle, the user would simply type in "circle" in the shape filter and press "Filter Table" as soon as that is completed a subset of the information is displayed in the table, only showing results of sightings that the shape of the UFO was a circle.
