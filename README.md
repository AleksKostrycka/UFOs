# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The webpage created during the module is working as intended, but we would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape to enhance the website. 
## Results
The website built during the Module had functionality to filter by the date of the UFO sighting. Currently it includes additional filter capabilities to further narrow down a specific subset of UFO sightings. In the follwing we will provide brief instructions on how a user can filter through the list of sightings to create a subset of the data based on the shape of the unidentified flying object they might be interested in studying more. 

For example if someone wanted to narrow down the sightings to focus on a specific shape, circle, the user would simply type in "circle" in the shape filter and press "Filter Table" as soon as that is completed a subset of the information is displayed in the table, only showing results of sightings that the shape of the UFO was a circle.

## Summary
In summary there is one drawback that can be seen in the filtering function of the website. It would be helpful to a user if the filter had a drop down menu with the options to chose a specific filter. For example, in the shape filter, if you are a new user to the website and data you would not know which shapes are available to filter on, a drop down would solve this issue. This is also common across all other filters created. 
* One recommendation for further development is to add additional data into the data.js file to create a world wide depository of all UFO sightings that a user can filter through and possibly find patterns or relationships between areas of sightings and frequency. 
* Additional recommentation for further development is to expand this webpage to include tags and links from these accounts to other resources, if available, that have already studied these sightings. Each instance in a table could be a direct pathway to news paper articles, NASA information to try to validate some of these sightings and dispute the ones that were already debunked.
